# I'm learning React, so i decided to write this simple forum.
It provides basic user authentication, which allows them create own posts.
Unregistered users can only see posts, but not create own.
## Now it running on https://aperekhozhuk-forum-react.netlify.com/
Because of platform features I have some problems with routing (you can access only main page by direct link, passed in your browser's address line)
## For server-side I'm using my own API
You can see it on https://github.com/aperekhozhuk/FlaskAPI <br>
Now it's running on free Python hosting just for development and testing client-side<br>
You can access it on https://aperekhozhuk.pythonanywhere.com
